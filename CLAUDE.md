# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **production-ready** Stripe dashboard application built with Python, using FastAPI and Streamlit for creating a comprehensive web-based dashboard to visualize Stripe data with Pandas and Plotly. The application provides complete financial analytics for Team Orlando Water Polo Club with advanced features including AI-powered insights, customer management, subscription analytics, and automated reporting.

## Development Commands

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies using uv (preferred package manager)
uv sync

# Alternative: install with pip
pip install -e .
```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Run the Streamlit dashboard (primary application)
uv run streamlit run app.py

# Alternative: Run with specific port
uv run streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501

# Run the basic hello world app
python main.py
```

### Dashboard Access
Once running, access the dashboard at: **http://localhost:8501**
